    <div class="description">
      Simple Config is a plugin designed to make application-wide configuration settings easy to set and access in an object-oriented fashion.
    </div>

    <p>Rails already provides a way of configuring the framework on a per-environment basis but other than global variables/constants set in each environment file or environment.rb, there isn’t a built-in way of providing application-specific settings.

One simple solution is to simply put all of your app configuration into a YAML file and load this somewhere in your environment, but here at Reevoo we wanted something a little bit more flexible that we could use across all of our applications and Simple Config is what we came up with.</p><h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>The plugin comes with a rake task to get you up and running quickly, so start by running that.

$ rake simple_config:setup

This will create a config/settings folder and a blank settings file for each of the main Rails environments. It will also create a copy of the SimpleConfig initializer in config/initializers/configuration.rb1.

Now, if you open up the configuration.rb initializer, you will see something like this:

SimpleConfig.for :application do

  # your app configuration here

  load File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'config', "settings", "#{RAILS_ENV}.rb"), :if_exists? => true
  load File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'config', "settings", "local.rb"),        :if_exists? => true

end

This is where you can set any configuration variables that are required across all Rails environments. The load method works just like Ruby’s built-in load method, except the contents of the file it loads are evaluated within the context of the SimpleConfig.for block. The :if_exists? flag, when set to true, means that the file will only be loaded if it exists, otherwise it will simply be ignored.

Variables can be overwritten, and are defined in the order that they are loaded, so you can set up default values in the above file and override them in the environment files.

As well as loading a settings file for your current Rails environment, a file called “local.rb” is loaded which is designed as a place for you to override variables specific to your own development environment—you can just keep a copy of this locally without having to check it into your version control system2.</p>
